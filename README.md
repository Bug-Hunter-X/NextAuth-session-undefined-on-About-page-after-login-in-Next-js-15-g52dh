# NextAuth session undefined on About page after login in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates a bug where the NextAuth session is undefined on a protected page ('/about') after successful login, even though `getServerSideProps` successfully retrieves the session.

The issue seems to be related to how Next.js 15 handles the session object within `getServerSideProps`.  The session object is properly fetched, but it does not propagate correctly to the page component.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You will see a message indicating that you are not logged in.
5. Attempt to login via the auth flow; after successful login, the About page will still show the message that you are not logged in.

**Expected Behavior:** After successful login, the About page should display the message indicating that the user is logged in.

**Possible Causes:**  The issue might be linked to how Next.js 15 handles the revalidation process or the asynchronous nature of `getServerSideProps`. There may be a timing issue. It is also possible there's a mismatch in how the session is being passed and consumed between the `getServerSideProps` and the About component.

**Solution:** The solution shows how to correctly pass the session and handle the revalidation, making sure the session data is available during rendering.
